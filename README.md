`analyze_espn_projections_data.ipynb` shows an analysis on 2020 projection data across QB, RB, WR, TE, D/ST, and K. We use $R^2$ and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) to assess the efficacy and precision of these projections.
`analyze_espn_projections_sit_start.ipynb` shows an analysis on multiple years of projection data to determine whether this data is useful in sit/start decisions.
